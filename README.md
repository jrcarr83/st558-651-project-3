# ST558-651 Project 3

## Introduction
In this project we are finding a dataset that is interesting to us and creating a shiny app that allows the user to export the data, explore it, fit models, and create predictions from those models. I chose a dataset that was curated from an R package called `nbastatR`, which you can find <a href="https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/nbastatR/versions/0.1.10131" target="_blank">here</a>.
